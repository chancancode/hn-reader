      "body": "I've never read any programming books or taken any classes, I've just read a lot of code written by others and also written some myself. Here's my advice after 15 years of reading both brilliant and shitty JS code:a) Don't use anonymous functions ... You want your program to be easy to understand, so come up with a name for the function and put it as a sub-function at the bottom of the current function.b) I love the Nodejs implementation of modules and I would say it's the main reason behind Nodejs success. But it doesn't make sense in the HTTP world. Imagine having to download 100 dependency files each time you visit a webpage.c) I have a keyboard macro for \" +  + \". So if you don't save an extra keystroke, what's the deal? It might be useful if you have nasty habits like building HTML or SQL by concatenating strings though. (don't do that).d) Just declare your variables at the top of the function and stop worrying about scope, (while listening to Bobby McFerrin.)e) I can somewhat agree here. But where it's really needed you should make a copy or clone function. And if it's not really needed you shouldn't. Makes you write less complicated code because of laziness.f) Give it a name!  function Car() {var car = this;}   Or if you don't want people to understand your code:  var that = this;  g) You are probably trying to make your function do too much! If you Do want to have one function to rule them all, pass an object to it.h) It's possible to make async code intuitive. Stop using anonymous functions will help a lot! But it's not That easy. Promises is just another (ineffective; it just threats the symptoms) paradigm to reason with async code.i) We don't need classes. The prototype already work great. It might be hard to learn but once you understand it's brilliant! (I don't blame you if you never will, it's hard to learn an old dog to sit).\n\nI encourage you to use the paradigms you believe in, and also to try different solutions, and think outside the box. But don't force certain paradigms by changing the language itself. One exception being Node.js where you are forced into making modules. (but some people are stubborn and use Browserify to circumvent it).",

The es5 spec is 6 years old at this point and it feels to me like es6 is taking forever to be implemented. Most of the changes are there to make things more consistent and reduce pitfalls and edge cases - let and const to solve the problems with var, fat arrows make functions cleaner and solve the this binding problem, classes and modules formalize what everyone has been trying to do in JS for years just in different ways.  No doubt there's some learning to do, but on the whole it seems like a very conservative and solid list of enhancements.",

I'm worried they could be a maintenance liability in large projects, but that remains to be seen.\n\n* Async functions/generators in ES7 will probably take a while to get used to, as well, but I felt the same way about Promises when they were first introduced, and they didn't turn out to be too bad.

So it uses parens if there are no params, but not otherwise?Again not surprising, a leading `=>` would be a syntax error so `()` is an obvious compromise which can be naturally be extended to add args, e.g:    evens.map((v) => v + 1)   > Seriously another String delimiter?    `Hello ${name}, how are you ${time}?`  Yep, String interpolation is incredibly useful especially in JavaScript which does a lot of string munging - this will lead to more succinct, readable code. Should be obvious why they didn't want to break existing JS by re-using \"\" double-quotes.> Why aren't we just using #{} like everyone else?Who's everyone else (Ruby inspired langs)? Scala uses ${1 + 1} or $var shorthand (same as Groovy, Kotlin, JSP EL, Haxe), C# 6 uses {var}, Swift uses \\(var) whilst Python and Java have string formats that use %(var)    var [a, , b] = [1,2,3];  > Is that seriously just whitespace and another comma?It's clearly ignoring matching the second element. Some languages choose to use `_` as a special ignore placeholder, JavaScript chose not to. Either way is not unintuitive with what it does so that's ok.\n\nThe other features are extremely useful if you need them, otherwise you can happily ignore them and use the subset you're comfortable with.",

That example is the same as:  f.apply(this, [1,2,3])  But it's cleaner syntax. The interesting part is that you can mix them in anywhere:  function f(x, y, z) {     return x + y + z;   }   a = [1,2];   b = [3];    [...a, ...b] == [].concat(a,b) == [1,2,3]   [0, ...a, 4, 5, ...b, 6] == [].concat([0],a,[4,5],b,[6]) == [0,1,2,4,5,3,6]   f(...a, ...b) == 6   f(1, 2, ...b) == 6   f(...a, 3) == 6   f(...b, 0, ...b) == 6   > ES6 is a mess. Javascript just got harder.Want some cheese with that whine? It got more complicated, yes. But I'm liking most of the changes, personally. A lot.
